# Development Notes: COVID-19 Trend Map

## Continuous Development

Follow these steps to get the app up-and-running after a fresh clone

1. `npm ci` Installs dependencies exactly according to the `package-lock.json`
2. Update the gitignored `.env` file with the necessary config vars/keys:
   - `heroku config:get DATABASE_URL -s  >> .env`
3. `heroku local` serves Angular's build folder (`dist/`) locally with Heroku connections (config vars, database, etc)
   - Useful for full-stack testing
   - The current app build is available on localhost port 5000 by default: http://localhost:5000
4. `ng build --watch` creates an app build in the `dist/` folder
   - After source code changes simply refresh the page to see updates (thanks to the `--watch` flag)

Other commands:

- `ng serve` is also useful to start the front-end in a local server
  - Useful for front-end testing, but it will be cut off from the server
  - Port 4200 is default: http://localhost:4200, but can be changed like `ng s --port 4201`
- `npm start` can be used as an alternative to `heroku local`, but heroku-specific tools will not be accessible

## Analysis Documentation

County map layer with size reduction (7.8 MB > 2.2 MB) process:

  1. Pull Esri's "USA Counties (Generalized)" from the Living Atlas
  2. Fix the layer's geometry by importing & exporting from GRASS via QGIS, then running QGIS's "Fix geometries" tool
  3. Dissolve based on FIPS to turn the resulting Polygon layer back into a MultiPolygon
  4. Export as GeoJSON with only Name, FIPS, and POPULATION; set coordinate precision to 2

## Timeline / TO DO

### Maintenance

To Do:

- [x] [follow-through] Add an About page with details on the data and "how-to" sections for directions (currently in progress) / Robust in-app documentation (about, links, data source, disclaimers, resources, etc)
- [x] [functional] Implement nearest-neighbor match-finding for search results so that coastal searches work better
- [ ] [debugging/functional] Utah is not displaying correctly due to their reporting at the "Local Health Departments" enumeration unit instead of by county: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/2570 and county-mapping: https://utah.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=110d43fbfacc411b8e74f4d12b63d881
- [ ] [functional] Add easier way to see the USA status report
- [ ] [efficiency/sharing] Implement server-side rendering (SSR) using Angular Universal to improve mobile load time and improve search engine optimization (SEO)
- [ ] [sharing] Implement different meta tags for share links (title, description, og:image, etc)
- [ ] [functional] Add option to display deaths in the map
- [ ] [functional] Add support for Puerto Rico
- [ ] [efficiency] Add lazy loading for historical COVID-19 data and UI to support
- [ ] [functional] Add zoom-to-extent button
- [ ] [design] Improve mobile design (scroll over map instead of slide-in)
- [ ] [debugging] Ensure cross-browser compatibility & stress testing
- [ ] [functional] Provide the option to automatically acquire the user's location using their device's location service
- [ ] [functional] Make the app more accessible so people with disabilities can use it well too
- [ ] [functional] Make temporal animation more efficient
- [ ] [functional] Explore options for further improving performance and load times
